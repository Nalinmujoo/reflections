When would you want to use a remote repository rather than
keeping all your work local?
So that my work doesn't get lost if my computer dies.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather 
than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your 
remote repository?
I may be doing some stuff on my local repo and Git may out
of nowhere pull a commit that has nothing to do with what
I am doing.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and 
branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Branch is adding another commit on the same repo that is
not in the main branch. Clone means just copying a repo. 
Forks is a GitHub term for copying a repo.
