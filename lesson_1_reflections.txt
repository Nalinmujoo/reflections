Ok, nice.

Well, it can help me try out a new thing without the fear of
loosing the old one.

Making commits at a logical change makes more sense than 
randomly making one.

Because linked files are not used by many people.

Use git log first, then press q. Use diff with the commit 
ids.

I can always go back to when it was working is reassuring to me.

Coding, duh.
